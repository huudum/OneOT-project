# OneOT-project
Project made as a demonstration for applying for a job at 1oT.
Frontend built using React, most of the UI style with React Bootstrap.
Backend built using Spring Boot and Rest API in Java.
Project will be run using gradle wrapper.

# Running the build
1.  Clone the repository from https://github.com/huudum/OneOT-project 
    OR
    Download the repository as a zip from dropbox link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/4ntp22oyuwpuwis/OneOT-project-master.zip?dl=0

2.  After either cloning or downloading & unpacking the project, you will need to open the folder in your terminal. 
    The terminal should be open at the root of the project: on the folder "OneOT-project"

3.  Use the packaged gradle wrapper to build the project.
    On Windows the command would be: "./gradlew bootRun". On other systems just "gradlew bootRun" should be fine.
    This will proceed to build and then run the project. 
    It might take a small amount of time, as it needs to download all dependencies for both SpringBoot and React application.
    The run will be successful on "80%", it will stay on 80% until closed.
   
 4. The React webapp will be hosted on "localhost:8080". 
    If this port is already occupied during bootRun, the process will fail.
    The REST api itself is hosted on localhost:8080/forecasts. Visiting this url will return a json file.
    
 # NOTES
   The React webapp is located in OneOT-project\src\main\resources\static folder using a built version. 
   The source code for the React app can be wound within: OneOT-project\src\main\java\com\OneOT\webapp\1ot-app\src
